#Door Buzz Enhancer
In our apartment no one can hear the door buzzer because it's lame and quiet. This program can run continuously on a 
Raspberry Pi with a USB microphone to detect when the buzzer sounds and send us a text alert us so that we know if 
someone is at the door no matter where we are.
